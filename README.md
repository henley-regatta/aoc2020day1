# aoc2020day1
Exemplar project in GO using documentation, packaging, testing. A LEARNING EXERCISE.

This is a minimal working example in GO of a complete program using packages, implementing Tests and providing documentation.

It just so happens to use some previously-written code restructured but that's not important. 

After pulling, you can build with:
`go build`
  
Check out the fancy documentation with:
`go doc -all day1`
  
And execute the unit tests with:
`go test -v ./day1`
